Thresholds:
ScoreStatus has been made an enum and contains the determineScoreStatus method from scala's ThresholdChecker
Scala's Thresholds has been moved from config package to run.threshold and converted to java

Logger:
Level.scala is converted to a java enum LogLevel;
Scala's Logger trait has been converted to a java abstract Logger class;
fansi.Str is still used by the java Logger
SttpLogWrapper has not been converted as it should be implemented in stryker4jvm

IgnoredMutationReason:
Scala trait IgnoredMutationReason has been converted to java interface.
Only the MutationExluded class has been added to core, the RegexParseError reason should be in scala-mutator

Exception:
Stryker4jvmException has been converted a java exception

files:
FileIO has been converted to a java interface;
The class DisFileIO is reimplemented with pure java, in case that we still want IO[Unit] for fileIO in stryker4jvm
we could implement a wrapper (should be possible).
FileResolver has been ignored as it relies on fs2, this may instead be added to stryker4jvm

Reporting:
Converted scala Reporter to abstract java class without any IO (wrappers may be necessary in stryker4jvm if we wish to work with IO there);
Converted the 'events' to java classes.
Everything else in reporting is ignored as it should be inside stryker4jvm!
