Renamed packages:
log -> logging
report -> reporting
extension.exception -> exception

Config:
The configuration reads excluded mutants but this depends on language specific implementations
We need to design a way for the language specific implementations to read the configurations
It appears that only ExcludedMutations are language specific!

Logging:
Loggers are provided by runners, how would the language specific implementations get hold of these loggers
in order to use them?

Exception:
Only the base 'stryker4sException' has been moved and renamed.
Stryker4jvmException is NOT sealed and could be extended by specific language implementations
The other exceptions in the file 'stryker4sException' should be moved to scala implementation

extension.MutationTypes:
Only the base trait 'Mutation' has been moved (package model) and renamed to 'Strand' as it only provides the mutation's name
All other classes should most likely be moved to scala mutator

Extensions:
Only DurationExtensions, FileExtensions and NumberExtensions have been moved to core
NumberExtensions is only used by ConsoleReporter
DurationExtensions is used by ConsoleReporter and TestRunners (-> outside jvm-core)
FileExtensions is used by numerous classes (also outside jvm-core)

files:
Only FileIO has been moved, the others might only be necessary when the entire model is added to core

run.Threshold:
Only the inner package 'threshold' is moved from 'run' package as it is used in reporting
